Database:
    Parameters for the database are defined in include/survey_lib.php:

    SERVERNAME: "localhost"
    USERNAME: "maxperez"
    PASSWORD: "hireme"
    DBNAME: "wmf_survey"
    TABLE: "fav_things"

    The sql file to create the table is include/wmf_survey.sql and the command to restore the database is 
        "mysql wmf_survey <  wmf_survey.sql"
    You may have to create the wmf_survey database on your system first, and have the rights to access it.

Version information:
    This shouldn't matter too much as I tried to write this as platform independent as I could, but it may be usefull information anyway.
    PHP: 5.5.38
    MySQL: Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.5.20, for osx10.6 (i386) using readline 5.1
    OSX: 10.10.5


File Structure:
    The template files are located at the root of this package, with lib, css and sql files in the 'include' directory. 
    You should be able to extract the following files:

        include
        index.php
        install_notes.txt
        report.php
        thanks.php

        ./include:
        footer.php
        header.php
        main.css
        survey_lib.php
        wmf_survey.sql


Application Description:

    The requirements for this project said that the data must be saved to the database. 
    so one could access the data using something like the following, depending on the specifics of your database:
        "mysqldump -u USERNAME -p -h HOST --no-create-info --skip-triggers YOURDATABASENAME fav_things --where='id=12345678'"

            The task: PHP+MySQL survey app

            A PHP application with the following features:

                A survey page asks a number of questions in an HTML form. Some questions are multiple choice, some have free text.
                When the form is submitted, the answers are saved. A thank you page is displayed.
                A report page summarizes the previously submitted answers. For multiple-choice questions, the report should show the number of responses for each choice. 
                For free text questions, the report should show the three most common unique answers along with the number of responses for each of those popular answers.
                Individual submissions must be saved to the database for later export. The export feature should not actually be implemented.

            Technical requirements:

                Use MySQL.
                Do not use a framework such as Laravel or Drupal. You may use a pre-existing autoloader or unit testing library.
                The report page should be efficient, taking a short time to generate even if there are a very large number of responses.
                Use transactions if they are necessary to guarantee consistency.
                Describe any necessary setup.
                CSS is optional and will not be assessed.
